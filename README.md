# Windows virtual desktop sandbox

This repo contains an example how to run a Windows virtual desktop on Instruqt.

This track uses a Windows Server 2019 VM: [`instruqt/windows-server`](https://github.com/instruqt/packer-windows-server), and an Alpine container that is used as a proxy for running challenge lifecycle scripts and terminal access.
